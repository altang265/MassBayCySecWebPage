<p class="paragraph">MassBay has responded to the growing regional and national need for well-trained cybersecurity professionals by
    offering a stackable program that consists of two certificates and an A.S. degree program in Cybersecurity, which
    is  approved by the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education. The stackable nature of the program allows
    students to earn multiple certificates while pursuing their Associate Degree. These academic programs align with
    the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework of the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) guidelines. The programs offer hands-on training using
    state-of-the-art equipment in our computer laboratories. Students graduating from the Cybersecurity programs
    are prepared for industry standard certifications such as Cisco and CompTIA.
</p>
<h2>Associate in Science Degree</h2>

<h3>Cybersecurity Curriculum</h3>
<p class="paragraph">The Cybersecurity Associate in Science degree provides courses and content that are informed by two major sources
    of proven requirements for cybersecurity education in 2-year colleges: NICE Framework from National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) and Knowledge Unit required for National Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) in
    Information Assurance/Cyber Defense (IA/CD) designation, a program jointly sponsored by the National Security
    Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). </p>

<h3>Advanced Cybersecurity Certificate</h3>
<p class="paragraph">This certificate, the second-level in a stackable certificate model, offers non-traditional, under-represented,
    career- changer, and veteran students in addition to traditional students, skills in a field with great job
    opportunities. The security field used to require a higher level of education; however, this requirement has
    changed recently and the demand for hiring those with cybersecurity knowledge is growing fast.</p>

<!--I tried adding the two columns styling trick mentioned on https://www.massbay.edu/styles but it does not look as
nice because of the font size. You can see the difference by looking at the A.S. section and the certificate section.-->
