        With ever increasing threats and risks to organizations’ information and data, the need for employees who can
        identify, prevent, mitigate, and address the threats to their network is at an all time high. MassBay has
        responded to the growing regional and national need for well-trained cybersecurity professionals by creating
        a Center for Cybersecurity Education. The Center is built around MassBay’s certificates and the first A.S.
        degree programs in Cybersecurity, which is  approved by the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education.
        These academic programs align with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework of
        the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) guidelines.
        The programs offer hands-on training using state-of-the-art equipment in our computer laboratories. Students
        graduating from the Cybersecurity programs are prepared for industry standard certifications such as Cisco
        and CompTIA.
    </p>
    <h4>The Center's role is to:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Share curriculum and best practices with community colleges</li>
        <li>Engage student in the field through workshops and competitions</li>
        <li>Offer educational resources and events and promoting security awareness</li>
        <li>Collaborate with regional high schools and other organizations to recruit students to maximize
            the diversity of the field</li>
        <li>Collaborate with other community colleges and 4-year institutions (both public and private)
            on projects as well as creating pathway for graduates with associate degree</li>
        <li>Collaborate with regional industry, professional organizations (ISC2, CompTIA), state and local IT/security
            departments, and others (chambers of commerce) to facilitate resources and fill the gap in Cybersecurity workforce</li>
    </ul>
