They must hire and train their employees to identify, mitigate and address the threats to their cyber infrastructure. Thus the need for cybersecurity professionals is growing. MassBay has responded to the growing regional and national need for well-trained cybersecurity professionals by creating certificate and A.S. degree programs in Cybersecurity. Our academic programs align with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and provide academic pathways to well-paid jobs and careers in related professions.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The programs offer hands-on training on state-of-the-art equipment in our computer laboratories. Students in the Cybersecurity/IT programs are prepared for industry standard certifications such as Network+, CompTIA+.</p><p class="paragraph">MassBay offers the opportunity to earn a marketable credential and to gain the knowledge and skills that will prepare you to perform network and security technician jobs. You will be able to administer and configure networks while applying cybersecurity best practices.</p><h2>Student Projects</h2><p><a class="major-link" href="https://sites.google.com/post.massbay.edu/fall-2020-stem-expo/home/computer-science" target="_blank">MassBay Cybersecurity Student Projects Showcase →</a></p><h2 class="sans-teal">MassBay Cybersecurity</h2><p><a class="major-link" href="https://www.massbay.edu/stem">Read Curriculum and Learning Outcomes →</a></p><h2 class="sans-teal">Start your career in cybersecurity at MassBay!</h2><p><a class="major-link" href="/admissions/how-to-apply">Apply Now! →</a></p><h2 class="sans-teal">Already enrolled at MassBay?</h2><p><a class="major-link" href="https://baynavigator.massbay.edu/psp/saprod/?cmd=login&amp;languageCd=ENG&amp;" target="_blank">Register Today! →</a></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Associate in Science Degree Program</h2><div class="rule-teal">&nbsp;</div><h3>Cybersecurity</h3><p>The Cybersecurity Associate in Science degree provides courses and content that are aligned with two major sources of proven requirements for cybersecurity education in 2-year colleges: NICE Framework from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Knowledge Unit required for National Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Information Assurance/Cyber Defense (IA/CD) designation, a program jointly sponsored by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The goal of this program is to offer a balanced and comprehensive security program that could lead to the CAE-2Y designation for MassBay. The objective of this program is to provide students with such knowledge, skills, and abilities that are expected from a student who has earned an associate degree in cybersecurity from a CAE-2Y designated program. Students completing this program will be able to successfully pass a number of CompTIA and Cisco’s certifications.</p><div class="rule-green">&nbsp;</div><div class="program-course"><a href="https://massbayedunew.s3.amazonaws.com/curriculum-sheets/Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics/degree/Curriculum-Sheet-STEM-Cybersecurity-AS.pdf" target="_blank">Cybersecurity Curriculum</a></div><div class="program-learning-outcomes"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/massbayedunew/learning-outcomes/Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics/degree/learning-outcomes-associate-science-cyber-security.pdf" target="_blank">Learning Outcomes</a></div><div class="rule-green">&nbsp;</div><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Cybersecurity Certificate Programs</h2><div class="rule-teal">&nbsp;</div><h3>Cybersecurity</h3><p>This certificate is designed to prepare students with the knowledge and skills that will enable them to perform network and security technician jobs.

Students completing this certificate are encouraged to gain industry credentials by taking CompTIA’s Network+ and Security+ exams, as well as CISCO’s ICND1.</p><div class="rule-green">&nbsp;</div><div class="program-course"><a href="https://massbayedunew.s3.amazonaws.com/curriculum-sheets/Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics/certificate/Curriculum-Sheet-STEM-Cybersecurity-C.pdf" target="_blank">Cybersecurity Curriculum</a></div><div class="program-learning-outcomes"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/massbayedunew/learning-outcomes/Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics/certificate/learning-outcomes-certificate-cyber-security.pdf" target="_blank">Learning Outcomes</a></div><div class="rule-green">&nbsp;</div><h3>Advanced Cybersecurity</h3><p>This certificate, the second-level in a stackable certificate model, offers non-traditional, under-represented, career-changer, and veteran students in addition to traditional students, skills in a field with great job opportunities. The security field used to require a higher level of education; however, this requirement has changed recently and the demand for hiring those with cybersecurity knowledge is growing fast. The stackable nature of these certificates allows students to earn multiple certificates while pursuing their Associate Degree. In addition, the certificates allow students to not only earn an academic credential but also the opportunity to earn industry credentials by successfully passing industry standard certification exams.</p><div class="rule-green">&nbsp;</div><div class="program-course"><a href="https://massbayedunew.s3.amazonaws.com/curriculum-sheets/Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics/certificate/Curriculum-Sheet-STEM-Advanced-Cybersecurity-C.pdf" target="_blank">Advanced Cybersecurity Curriculum</a></div><div class="program-learning-outcomes"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/massbayedunew/learning-outcomes/Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics/certificate/learning-outcomes-certificate-advanced-cyber-security.pdf" target="_blank">Learning Outcomes</a></div><div class="rule-green">&nbsp;</div><h3>Contact the Dean of MassBay STEM to Find Out More!</h3><h4>Chitra Javdekar</h4><p class="paragraph">MassBay Community College<br>Dean of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)</p><h4>Email</h4><p class="paragraph"><a href="mailto:cjavdekar@massbay.edu">cjavdekar@massbay.edu</a></p><h4>Phone</h4><p class="paragraph"><a href="tel:+17812392585">781-239-2585</a></p>
