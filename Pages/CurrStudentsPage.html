        <p class="paragraph">The final course for students majoring in Cybersecurity Associate degree is the Capstone course (CS281).
            Students in this course use the knowledge and skills gained from previous networking and security courses
            to complete a semester-long project, study and pass CompTIA’s Security+ exam to earn the certificate,
            or work as an intern in an organization working on security-specific tasks. This option provides students
            with a solid understanding of what it takes to be a security professional.

<section id="Transfer-Information">
    <h4>Transfer Information</h4>
    <p>MassBay’s Cybersecurity graduates have successfully transferred to other Massachusetts 4-year institutions
        (both public and private) and graduated. The Center’s director is a member of the state’s Cyber Center,
        which is discussing articulation agreements and pathways for students majoring in Cybersecurity. Currently,
        Cybersecurity faculty at MassBay are in talks with UMass Lowell’s faculty to create such articulation.

        In addition to discussing your transfer goals with your professors, a good resource for transfer advice is
