            <h3>Information on Capstone Course (CS281)</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The Capstone course (CS281) is the final course for students seeking an Associate degree in Cybersecurity.
                &nbsp;Students in this course use the knowledge and skills gained from previous networking and security
                courses to complete a semester-long project, study and pass CompTIA’s Security+ exam to earn the
                certificate, or work as an intern in an organization working on security-specific tasks. This option
                provides students with a solid understanding of what it takes to be a security professional.</p>

                    complete a resume and work on LinkedIn and Handshake profiles. We can also assist with
                    connecting you to resources and opportunities to aid in your internship search.</li>

                <li>Visit the Career Services Internship Page https://www.massbay.edu/career/career-internship-

            <h3>The Cybersecurity Club</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The Cybersecurity Club provides an opportunity for students of all majors who have
                a vested interest in cybersecurity in all aspects of the field from its history to modern day trends.
                The club focuses both on educating members concerning different concepts of cybersecurity and its
                application using hands-on group projects and collegiate cyber competitions. The goal is to create a
                cybersecurity community where members can practice and learn from each other, gain practical
                experience, prepare for cybersecurity competition, and present the outcome of these extra-curricular

            <h3>Transfer Information</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">MassBay’s Cybersecurity graduates have successfully transferred to other
                Massachusetts 4-year institutions (both public and private) and graduated. The director of the Center
                for Cybersecurity Education is a member of MassCyberCenter’s working group, which supports the training
                and education of cybersecurity professionals in the Commonwealth through collaboration and partnerships.
                One of the core activities of this group is expanding articulation agreements and pathways for students
                majoring in Cybersecurity. Currently, Cybersecurity faculty at MassBay are in talks with UMass Lowell’s
                faculty to create such articulation. In addition to discussing your transfer goals with your professors,
                a good resource for transfer advice is MassBay’s Transfer Advising webpage at
