<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>MassBay has responded to the growing regional and national need for well-trained cybersecurity professionals by
    offering two certificates and an A.S. degree program in Cybersecurity, which is  approved by the Massachusetts
    Department of Higher Education. These academic programs align with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity
    Education (NICE) framework of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Association for Computing
    Machinery (ACM) guidelines. The programs offer hands-on training using state-of-the-art equipment in our computer
    laboratories. Students graduating from the Cybersecurity programs are prepared for industry standard certifications
    such as Cisco and CompTIA.</p>

<h3>Cybersecurity Certificate</h3>
<p>This certificate is designed to prepare students with the knowledge and skills that will enable them to perform network

<h3>Advanced Cybersecurity Certificate</h3>
<p>This certificate, the second-level in a stackable certificate model, offers non-traditional, under-represented, career-changer,
    and veteran students in addition to traditional students, skills in a field with great job opportunities. The security
    field used to require a higher level of education; however, this requirement has changed recently and the demand for
    hiring those with cybersecurity knowledge is growing fast. The stackable nature of these certificates allows students
    to earn multiple certificates while pursuing their Associate Degree. In addition, the certificates allow students to not
    only earn an academic credential but also the opportunity to earn industry credentials by successfully passing industry
    standard certification exams.</p>

<!--I tried adding the two columns styling trick mentioned on https://www.massbay.edu/styles but it does not look as
nice because of the font size. You can see the difference by looking at the A.S. section and the certificate section.-->
