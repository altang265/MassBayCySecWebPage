<h2>Associate in Science Degree Program</h2>

<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>The Cybersecurity Associate in Science degree provides courses and content that are aligned with two major sources
    of proven requirements for cybersecurity education in 2-year colleges: NICE Framework from National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) and Knowledge Unit required for National Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) in
    Information Assurance/Cyber Defense (IA/CD) designation, a program jointly sponsored by the National Security Agency
    (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The goal of this program is to offer a balanced and
    comprehensive security program that could lead to the CAE-2Y designation for MassBay. The objective of this program
    is to provide students with such knowledge, skills, and abilities that are expected from a student who has earned an
    associate degree in cybersecurity from a CAE-2Y designated program. Students completing this program will be able to
    successfully pass a number of CompTIA and Cisco’s certifications.</p>

<h3>Advanced Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>This certificate, the second-level in a stackable certificate model, offers non-traditional, under-represented, career-changer,
    and veteran students in addition to traditional students, skills in a field with great job opportunities. The security
    field used to require a higher level of education; however, this requirement has changed recently and the demand for
    hiring those with cybersecurity knowledge is growing fast. The stackable nature of these certificates allows students
    to earn multiple certificates while pursuing their Associate Degree. In addition, the certificates allow students to not
    only earn an academic credential but also the opportunity to earn industry credentials by successfully passing industry
    standard certification exams.</p>
