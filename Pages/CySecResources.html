            <p class="paragraph">The National Cyber League is the most inclusive, performance-based, learning-centered collegiate Cybersecurity competition, which enables
            students to prepare and test themselves against practical Cybersecurity challenges that they will likely face
            in the workforce, such as identifying hackers from forensic data, pentesting and auditing vulnerable websites,
            recovering from ransomware attacks, and more. Open to U.S. high school and college students, the NCL is a
            community and virtual training ground that allows students to develop and demonstrate their technical
            Cybersecurity skills, helping students bridge the gap from curriculum to career. <a href="https://nationalcyberleague.org/">https://nationalcyberleague.org/</a>
