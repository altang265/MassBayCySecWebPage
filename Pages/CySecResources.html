    <h3>The National Cyber League (NCL)</h3>
    <p>is the most inclusive, performance-based, learning-centered collegiate Cybersecurity competition, which enables
        students to prepare and test themselves against practical Cybersecurity challenges that they will likely face
        in the workforce, such as identifying hackers from forensic data, pentesting and auditing vulnerable websites,
        recovering from ransomware attacks, and more. Open to U.S. high school and college students, the NCL is a
        community and virtual training ground that allows students to develop and demonstrate their technical
        Cybersecurity skills, helping students bridge the gap from curriculum to career. <a href="https://nationalcyberleague.org/">https://nationalcyberleague.org/</a>
