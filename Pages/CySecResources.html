        <p class="paragraph">The National Cyber League is the most inclusive, performance-based, learning-centered
            collegiate Cybersecurity competition, which enables students to prepare and test themselves against
            practical Cybersecurity challenges that they will likely face in the workforce, such as identifying
            hackers from forensic data, pentesting and auditing vulnerable websites, recovering from ransomware
            attacks, and more. Open to U.S. high school and college students, the NCL is a community and virtual
            training ground that allows students to develop and demonstrate their technical Cybersecurity skills,
            helping students bridge the gap from curriculum to career.
