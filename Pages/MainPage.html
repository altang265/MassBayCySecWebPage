    With ever increasing threats and risks to organizations’ information and data, the need for employees who can
    identify, prevent, mitigate, and address the threats to their network is at an all time high. MassBay has responded
    to the growing regional and national need for well-trained cybersecurity professionals by creating a Center for
    Cybersecurity Education. The Center is built around MassBay’s Cybersecurity programs (certificates and the first
    A.S. degree in MA) and align with national frameworks and educational guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>The Center's role:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Share curriculum and best practices with community colleges</li>
        <li>Engage students in the field through workshops and competitions</li>
        <li>Offer educational resources and events&nbsp;promoting security awareness</li>
        <li>Collaborate with regional high schools and other organizations to recruit students to maximize the diversity
            of the field</li>

        <li>Collaborate with other community colleges and 4-year institutions (both public and private) on projects as
            well as creating pathways for graduates with associate degree</li>

        <li>Collaborate with regional industry, professional organizations (ISC2, CompTIA), state and local IT/security
            departments, and others (chambers of commerce) to facilitate resources and fill the gap in the Cybersecurity
            workforce</li>
