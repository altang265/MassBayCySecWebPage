        Organizations must increasingly limit the risk to information and data. They must hire
        and train their employees to identify, mitigate and address the threats to their cyber
        infrastructure. Thus the need for cybersecurity professionals is growing. MassBay has
        responded to the growing regional and national need for well-trained cybersecurity professionals
        by creating certificate and A.S. degree programs in Cybersecurity. Our academic programs align
        with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework of the National Institute
        of Standards and Technology, and provide academic pathways to well-paid jobs and careers in related professions.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The programs offer hands-on training on state-of-the-art equipment in our computer laboratories.
        Students in the Cybersecurity/IT programs are prepared for industry standard certifications such
        as Network+, CompTIA+.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        MassBay offers the opportunity to earn a marketable credential and to gain the knowledge and skills that will
        prepare you to perform network and security technician jobs. You will be able to administer and configure networks
        while applying cybersecurity best practices.</p>
